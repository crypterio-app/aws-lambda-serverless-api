###  Lambda Serverless API | AWS
This blueprint provisions a complete serverless API stack on AWS, combining compute, routing, and data persistence with event-driven automation

⚙️ Core Components:
```
✅ Lambda – Provides compute for API logic, written in Node.js or Python.
✅ API Gateway – Acts as the HTTP entry point, routing external API requests to Lambda functions.
✅ DynamoDB – Serves as the fully managed NoSQL database for storing API data .
✅ Argo Events – Extends the system with event-driven workflows.
```

🔁 Event Automation
```
Listen to AWS or external events (e.g., S3 upload, API Gateway request, SNS topic message).
Trigger Lambda invocations or Argo Workflows for downstream automation.
Enable hybrid workloads that bridge AWS serverless and Kubernetes-native CI/CD environments.
```

🏗️ Deployment Options
```
Terraform or AWS CDK – Infrastructure as Code setup for reproducible environments.
Argo CD – Manages continuous delivery of Argo Events and related workflows in Kubernetes.
GitOps Integration – Automatically syncs changes from a Git repository to your environment.
```
